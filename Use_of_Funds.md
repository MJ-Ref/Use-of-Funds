**Key Changes Made for This Investor Document:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Simplified language, focused on key takeaways.
*   **Investor Focus:** Highlights milestones, runway, and how the money drives value.
*   **Percentage Allocation:** Added percentages to the budget table for quick insights.
*   **Professional Tone:** Structured for formal presentation.
*   **"Why $1.2M" Section:** Directly addresses the rationale for the funding amount.
*   **Simplified Office & Admin:** Merged GL insurance with office costs for a cleaner "Professional Services & Admin" line in the summary, while still accounting for it. Adjusted the "Miscellaneous Admin" to provide a small buffer for bank fees and other minor costs, making the overall Professional Services & Admin category total $20,750 as intended (Legal $7k + Accounting/Tax $2.5k + E&O Insurance $1.25k + Office Ops $9k + Misc Admin $1.005k = $20,750 â€” *Self-correction during thought process: made Office Ops a sub-line under Prof & Admin for the investor view to streamline main categories in the table*). Re-categorized Office & Operations ($9k) and Misc Admin ($1.005k) into the Professional Services & Administrative line for the summary table to keep top-level categories very high-level. The previous python script separated them, which is fine for internal detail, but for investors, fewer top lines are better. The total spend remains identical. The table clearly shows the breakout.
